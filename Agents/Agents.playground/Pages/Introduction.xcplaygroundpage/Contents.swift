 # Introduction
 
 Combine random number generation with loops and conditional statements, and the pixel now becomes an "agent" and can move freely based on different behavioural patterns.
 
 Most of the pages in this playground present visual output in the Assistant Editor.
 
 If you do not see any output, remember to turn on the Assistant Editor, and then click the menu to switch to the Timeline:
